# The Game Rule

You can choose an old language (before Java) or one for JVM.

## The Program

1. read the `source` file in the list `numbers`
2. define `ordered` list of `numbers` using a custom sorting method
3. define a `occurrences` map to associate each number in `numbers` with its occurrences
4. print all the `occurrences`
